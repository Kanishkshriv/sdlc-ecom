# Basic E-commerce Recommendation Algorithm Prototype

**Author:** Kanishk
**Date:** April 19, 2025
**Status:** Initial Prototype

## Overview

This project contains a basic Python script demonstrating a fundamental approach to building an e-commerce recommendation system. The goal is to provide a simple, understandable example of how we can suggest relevant products to users based on patterns in user interaction data (like product ratings).

This prototype serves as a learning tool and a foundation for understanding more complex recommendation techniques.

## Methodology: Item-Based Collaborative Filtering

The approach used here is **Item-Based Collaborative Filtering**. The core idea is:

1.  **Find Similar Items:** Analyze the interaction data (e.g., user ratings) to determine which items are "similar". Items are considered similar if the same users tend to rate them in a similar way. For example, if users who rate `Product A` highly also tend to rate `Product B` highly, these items are considered similar.
2.  **Generate Recommendations:** For a specific user, look at the items they have previously interacted with positively (e.g., bought or rated highly). Recommend other items that are highly similar to those items, which the user hasn't interacted with yet.

Essentially, it answers the question: *"What other items are similar to the ones this user already likes?"*

## How the Code Works (High-Level Steps)

The provided Python script (`[recommendation.py]`) performs the following steps:

1.  **Load Data:** Starts with sample data representing user interactions (user ID, item ID, rating).
2.  **Build User-Item Matrix:** Organizes the data into a table where rows represent users, columns represent items, and the values indicate the rating (or interaction). Missing values are treated as 'no interaction'.
3.  **Calculate Item Similarity:** Computes a similarity score (using Cosine Similarity) between every pair of items based on how users rated them in the matrix. This results in an item-item similarity matrix.
4.  **Generate Recommendations:**
    * Takes a specific user ID as input.
    * Identifies items the user has rated positively.
    * For items the user *hasn't* rated, it calculates a predicted score. This score is based on the similarity of the unrated item to the items the user *has* rated, weighted by those ratings.
    * Ranks the unrated items by their predicted score and returns the top few as recommendations.

## Example Output

Running the script will print:
* The initial interaction data.
* The constructed User-Item Matrix.
* The calculated Item-Item Similarity Matrix.
* Finally, the top recommended items (and their predicted relevance score) for specific example users.

## Limitations of this Basic Prototype

* **Scalability:** This simple implementation may become slow with millions of users or items. More advanced techniques are needed for large datasets.
* **Cold-Start Problem:** It struggles to recommend items for new users (who have no rating history) or recommend new items (which haven't been rated yet).
* **Data Sparsity:** In real-world scenarios, users rate only a tiny fraction of available items. This sparsity can make finding meaningful similarities challenging.
* **Basic Similarity:** Relies solely on co-rating patterns; doesn't consider item content (description, category, etc.).

## Next Steps & Potential Improvements

* **Evaluation:** Implement metrics to measure the quality of recommendations (e.g., precision, recall).
* **Data Integration:** Test with larger, real-world datasets.
* **Algorithm Exploration:** Investigate more advanced techniques like Matrix Factorization (SVD), User-Based Collaborative Filtering, Content-Based Filtering, or Hybrid approaches.
* **Implicit Feedback:** Adapt the model to work with implicit data (clicks, views, purchases) instead of just explicit ratings.
* **Optimization:** Explore libraries and techniques for handling large, sparse matrices efficiently.
